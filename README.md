# Projects

These are my hobby projects that I have done in my own personal time.

## ESP8266 ##
This is a nice small chip (an alternative to the arduino) that can controlled over the internet. This project looked into controlling the light bulb using the chip from your phone/computer using MQTT protocol.

## iosapps ##
This was an IOS app written to communicate using MQTT protocol and can be used to control the relay of the light bulb to turn it off and on using an app.
